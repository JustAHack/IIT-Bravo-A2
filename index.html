      <h2>Team Bravo - Who are we and what is our mission?</h2>
      <p>Team Bravo was formed as a group of students studying Intro to Information Technology with RMIT. We are a team of six members with varying interest in the IT industry. We are working on a new project idea which you can read all about further down this page. In the IT Technologies page you can see our research into topics in relation to the technologies we anticipated would be required for further research and development of our project. You can find information about us by visiting our Ideal Jobs & Industry Data page and learn about our team members by checking out Meet the Team page and Team Profile.</p>
