<h2>Machine Learning </h2>
<h3>what does it do?</h3>
<p>Machine learning is at its core the use of AI or “artificial intelligence” to create programs that can develop and expand upon their own pattern recognition based on user input as well as stored data from either the user or the data stored by the software itself to better understand what the users want and need, without the developer needing to specifically program the specific task. It does this by imitating the way humans learn, over time and gradually adapting and evolving based on its experiences, there are many types of machine learning that impact the way the program achieves this, to name the most common types: </p>
<p>Supervised learning, the developer must monitor and assist the machine in order to train it to work on its own by providing it with labelled training data sets. </p>
<p>unsupervised learning, similar to the above but without labelled training data sets. </p>
<p>reinforcement learning, the system learns almost entirely on its own </p>

<p>Machine learning is used in an extreme amount of systems and programs that are used on a daily basis in all areas of technology such as: </p>
<p>Virtual assistants on your computer and mobile devices use machine learning to detect when you are talking to them, as well as collect and utilize data based on your day to day interactions with them in order to better understand your needs and give results better tailored to your preferences. </p>
<p>Google has multiple uses of machine learning, some of which are gathering of information from your searches and visits to better target ads that cater to your needs and wants, as well as using popular search terms from yourself as well as others to attempt to predict what are looking for by either auto filling your search or pushing results better relating to your search terms to the top of the web page. </p>
<p>PayPal uses machine learning as a means of fraud detection, to compare millions of transactions to determine whether the purchase is legitimate or illegitimate  </p>

<p>Recently there has been massive advancements in a machine learning ai program that was already something leaps ahead of its competitors, This open source Api named “dall-e-2 (https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) is a program that takes user input and creates a unique image based off of a collection of data that the system has scanned from the internet that closely matches the key terms, often creating unique pieces of art that are almost indistinguishable from something made from human development. </p>
<p>The future of machine learning is likely to continue to grow at an exponential rate,  with the continued every day use making machine learning a staple for most systems, this leads to constant discoveries and improvements in the field, although machine learning is not like other fields, due to the nature of machine learning itself the speed at which it advances is much more volatile than other fields, its common place that one minute something  ground breaking has been newly discovered and the next minute there is a new discovery makes that seem mundane “We all heard of Open AI’s GPT-2, and a few months later GPT-3 pushed the boundaries of what is possible and shook the entire internet in disbelief” (Tarek Amr ,Słupski, n.d.), with advances like these being common place its not hard to believe that something like a road of fully autonomous driving vehicles would be possible in the not too distant future, it is estimated that  “20% of new cars sales in China in 2030 will be for autonomous vehicles” (Liberty Advisor Group, n.d.).</p>
<p>Advancements in 5G technology are of great assistance to this,  network connectivity plays a critical role in the development of self driving vehicles, with better connectivity comes the possibility of making them faster, smarter and safer. “5G technology enables car connectivity so vehicles can connect to everything – other vehicles, the infrastructure, network services, and other road users. 5G is a critical enabler to all these technologies. Fast networks and connectivity allow autonomous cars to move around safely in the real world” (Liberty Advisor Group, n.d.). </p>

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>Machine learning has made a large impact on the world and the way society has evolved, from media to healthcare and commerce, all aspects of life will in some way be streamlined by the continued use and evolution of machine learning, you will be more likely to find a business or application that doesn’t in corporate machine learning in some fashion than you would the alternative, this isn’t without its negatives though as due to this people may feel like they have their privacy being taken away, and this isn’t entirely false either, due to all the data that is needed for machine learning to function correctly, business’s and the government will certainly know more about you and your day to day activities and interests than you intend for them to know, this information is often sold or traded off even further to other business’s and corporations that you hadn’t initially intended your data to be in possession of, making your digital finger print even greater and contributing to the targeted mass marketing potential of these businesses, I saw a perfect analogy for this on social media funnily enough “Modern society operates similarly to open source” </p>

<h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
<p>One prime example of how daily life can and already has started to be affected in my household is the use of machine learning in personal assistants, assisted with the use of other peripheral devices such as Wi-Fi connected lights as well as power point adapters, this has allowed me to hook my Google home personal assistant to these devices and then speak to my assistant telling to turn these devices on and off, or simply asking for a recipe while cooking or setting a timer for something to be ready all with the power of machine learning allowing the device to recognize my voice. </p>
<p>Another application that affects myself as well as most of society on a daily basis is the use of machine learning for things like personally customized adds based on my searches and frequent website visits, more often than not this is accurate and helpful to what you may actually want or need. </p>

<p>As further development of machine learning goes on its likely that the use of automation in day-to-day activities will become even more prominent, I expect myself to have near full automation to most utilities within my home in the near future, throughout my studies I also expect that I will get more knowledge and experience within this area in order to implement machine learning into projects that I do in the future. </p>

<p>In most common ways family and friends will likely already be affected by machine learning in the basic ways described prior, since personal assistants are a staple for mobile phone technology and personalized ads also being a staple of web content, and if they are not already it's unlikely for them to avoid this happening with machine learning being as close as it can be to a necessity in today's technological society. </p>
