        <h2>Meet team Bravo</h2>
        <p>The name Bravo derived from an early method of finding teams for the course. When it came to choosing our team’s name, we chose to stick with Bravo. Over the duration of the assessment, the name Bravo has had some inside jokes, but overall, really does go well with our team and our ideas.</p>
        
        <p>This page introduces each member of team Bravo. For each member you will find the following: Member’s Name, a photo, student number (#), the link to each member’s individual website, followed by an introduction from each member.</p>
