        <h2>Meet team Bravo</h2>
        <p>The name Bravo derived from an early method of finding teams for the course. When it came to choosing our team’s name, we chose to stick with Bravo. Over the duration of the assessment, the name Bravo has had some inside jokes, but overall, really does go well with our team and our ideas.</p>
        
        <p>This page introduces each member of team Bravo. For each member you will find the following: Member’s Name, a photo, student number (#), the link to each member’s individual website, followed by an introduction from each member.</p>

            Hi I’m Jo,
            Born in Victoria, I grew up in a small town marked ‘the centre of Victoria’. I'm 36 years old; I have two children, a 14yo son and a 10yo daughter. I wanted to be a paramedic and was very passionate about it. I spent six years as a volunteer First Responder (Advanced First Aid) with St John Ambulance Victoria, including 18 months as a grade IIII operations officer. As a result of my medical diagnosis, I could not continue in the medical field. Therefore, I re-evaluated what I could do, and the outcome happened to be Information Technology (IT). My decision to choose to study IT was very influential. Through conversation with a programmer friend, I began to realise I have a deep underlying interest in the future of technology and how it can help for good.

            Hey, I'm Shay. 
            I was born an Indigenous Australian, with my biological father being Yugoslavian - known today as Serbia - and Maltese. My mother is Indigenous, with Irish in her line as well. Born an angry fighting nerd, my interest in computers was set to be guaranteed. Between the writing, gaming, existential dread and computing, there's not much time for other pastimes, but I make time. Or at least time signatures! I write music in my spare time. It's not good music, but it exists. Other things I like are pizza, swords, and comic sans. My next steps are more University, programming, video game design, law, music, creative writing, history, architecture, finance, and philosophy. There's no such thing as being too qualified, and they say that the Jack-of-All-Trades, Master of None, is better than the Master of One. I still will try and Master at least one.

            Hey howdy hey, I'm new to the whole programming and IT scene outside of doing it in high school a tiny bit; However, I have always had an interest in these areas, just never put any effort into officially pursuing them as a profession until now; I spend most of my time socialising with friends via discord or in person. Honestly, it's scarce that I'm not perpetually in conversation due to this; my central pass time would overwhelmingly be gaming; I'm always on the watch for what's new and exciting within this area and all tech, for that matter.

            I am 18 years old, have just recently finished my year 12 VCE and am studying for a Bachelor of IT at RMIT. I love most things IT-related, mainly computers and gaming consoles, however. Growing up, I fell in love with tech and devices from things like the Play station’s 1-5, the original Nintendo DS, Gameboys and more. Throughout my life, I have loved the outdoors and going on adventures with my family to places such as Lorne, The Grampians and Echuca. I have also been overseas to the U.S.A, where I’ve been to places such as New York, LA, Las Vegas and more. I am also an athletic person and have played many sports. The one I’m best at and my favourite to play is basketball.

            An <strong>Adventurer (ISFP)</strong> is a person with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Feeling (F), and Prospecting (P) personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.
            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Adventurers are more sensitive to stress and can feel overwhelmed easier than Assertive (A) Adventurers. This characteristic can allow them to see little problems before they become big problems. Though Turbulent Adventurers are likely to feel more comfortable with themselves than the average Turbulent personality type, they are still less at ease in their own lives than Assertive Adventurers.”(Myers-Briggs, no date)

            A <strong>Logistician (ISTJ)</strong>Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Thinking (T), and Judging (J) personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.
            Unexpected changes bother Logisticians more than any other personality type, and this is especially true for <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logisticians. However, in their ongoing need to improve and with their sense of uncertainty, they may actually be more willing to change, despite a certain amount of distress, than the more settled Assertive (A) Logisticians. Turbulent Logisticians are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to express and act on their emotions than Assertive personality types. The positive side of their more expressive emotions is that they can make them more accessible to others.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

            A <strong>Logician (INTP)</strong> is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.
            Assertive (A) Logicians are likely to be more consistent than <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logicians due to confidence in the choices they make and being less influenced by others.
            Turbulent Logicians change their goals more often than their Assertive cousins. This can make these personalities more flexible problem-solvers – though perhaps too flexible at times.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

            Stress is less of an issue for Assertive (A) Entertainers. While difficult matters may hold the attention of <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Entertainers longer, it can also help them remain more aware, allowing them to perhaps alert or remind others of problems. Turbulent Entertainers tend to say they feel and express difficult emotions more than Assertive Entertainers. This tendency may create a conflict between their social natures and the need to express negative emotions – the two may not always be compatible.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Advocates are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. Both personality types are concerned with other people, but Assertive (A) Advocates are likely to be more hopeful, and Turbulent Advocates to focus on the difficult parts of a problem.  Because their regrets weigh on them more, Turbulent Advocates are more likely to learn from their mistakes than Assertive Advocates.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

        <h3>What these results mean for team Bravo…</h3>
        <p>
          The Myers-Briggs test indeed shows the mixed profile of personalities within our team, while there is a few quite prominent differences, there are several similarities. Five members out of six classed as introverted and only one as an extravert. Half the team are classed as observant while the others intuitive. There are both thinkers and feelers among the group along with most being classed as prospecting with 2 members being the judging character. The varying approaches to things among the group is likely to allow some to work well while others are more reserved and less communicative. The Adventurers of the team have open minds and are present in the moment. Our team leader highlights a much different personality to most being rational, methodical, and unexpected changes are a hassle to this Logistician. The flexible thinking and creativity of our Logician member brings in a different style to the group. The ‘Entertainer’ of our group, the individual extravert, likes to engage vibrantly and enjoys discovering the unknown. And having an Advocate in the group brings a member who has deep thoughtfulness and imagination, is quiet but uses these traits to provide successful outcomes (Myers-Briggs, no date). All members are of the Turbulent trait. Although this means something different to each personality type, this allows Bravo, as a team, to combine their abilities to overcome small issues before they become big. An ongoing need for improvement adds to the drive of the group, especially in a team leader. Further, flexibility in problem solving is important in any group and with an ability to hold attention on difficult matters the team extrovert may just come in needed. Finally having the traits of a worry-led Advocate could push the final outcome of the team assessment due to the need to focus on difficult parts of a problem (Myers-Briggs, no date). Overall, the combined traits amongst the members of team Bravo, although quite varied, blend reasonably. The team had built its hierarchy before understanding this combined information, yet the positions held would match the traits explained in the results of the personality test.
