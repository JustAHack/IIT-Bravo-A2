              <p>Hello, I’m Stephan, student number #s3960896,<br>I am 25 years old and currently live in Sydney, NSW. My hobbies include gaming when I can and cooking all the time. I have an interest in Cyber Security and computer building, I have a certificate III in IDMT, and that’s as far as my IT experience goes, but that was eight years ago now, and I’ve forgotten just about everything.

              <p>Hey howdy hey, my name is Nathen Hogan : s3964403<br> I'm new to the whole programming and IT scene outside of doing it in high school a tiny bit, although I have always had an interest in these areas just never put any effort into officially pursuing them as a profession until now, I spend most of my time socializing with friends via discord of in person, honestly its very rare that I'm not perpetually in conversation due to this, my main pass time would overwhelmingly be gaming, I'm always on the watch for what's new and exciting within this area and all tech for that matter really
