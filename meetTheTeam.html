              <p>Hello, I’m Stephan, student number #s3960896,<br>I am 25 years old and currently live in Sydney, NSW. My hobbies include gaming when I can and cooking all the time. I have an interest in Cyber Security and computer building, I have a certificate III in IDMT, and that’s as far as my IT experience goes, but that was eight years ago now, and I’ve forgotten just about everything.

              <p>Hey im Sahy #s3965753<br>I was born an Indigenous Australian, with my biological father being Yugoslavian - known today as Serbia - and Maltese. My mother is Indigenous, with Irish in her line as well. Born an angry fighting nerd, my interest in computers was set to be guaranteed. Between the writing, gaming, existential dread and computing, there's not much time for other pastimes, but I make time. Or at least, time signatures! I write music, in my spare time. It's not good music, but it exists. Other things I like are; pizza, swords and comic sans. My next steps are more University, doing programming, video game design, law, music, more creative writing, history, architecture, finance and philosophy. There's no such thing as being too qualified, and they say that the Jack-of-All-Trades, Master of None, is better than the Master of One. I still will try and Master at least one.</p>

              <p>Jo Stammers #s3955561<br>Born in Victoria, I grew up in a small town basically marked ‘the centre of Victoria’. Im 36 years old, I have 2 children, 14yo son and 10yo daughter. I wanted to be a paramedic, and was very passionate about it. I spent 6 years as a volunteer First Responder (Advanced First Aid) with St John Ambulance Victoria, including 18 months as a grade IIII operations officer. As a result of medical diagnoses, I was unable to continue in medical field and therefore led to me re-evaluating what I could do, and the outcome happened to be Information Technology (IT). My decision to choose to study IT was a very influential decision. Though conversation with a friend who is a programmer I began to realise I have an underlying deep interest in the future of technology and the ways in which it can help for good. I recall doing IT back in early high school (‘98-‘99) where I built a basic website using JavaScript from what I remember. I have just started studying to gain the bachelor of IT. I have experience in using computer-based telephone diallers and different databases and survey platforms. Currently learning processes of HTML and CSS.

I basically love most things IT related, mainly computers and gaming consoles though. Growing up I fell in love with tech and devices from things like the Playstation's  1-5, the original Nintendo DS, Gameboys and more. Throughout my life I have loved the outdoors and going on adventures to places with my family to places such as, Lorne, The Grampians and Echuca. I have also been overseas to the U.S.A where I’ve been to places such as New York, LA, Las Vegas and more. Anyways I also am an athletic person and have played a lot of sports. The one I’m best at and my favourite to play is basketball.</p>

                <p>Hey howdy hey, my name is Nathen Hogan : s3964403<br> I'm new to the whole programming and IT scene outside of doing it in high school a tiny bit, although I have always had an interest in these areas just never put any effort into officially pursuing them as a profession until now, I spend most of my time socializing with friends via discord of in person, honestly its very rare that I'm not perpetually in conversation due to this, my main pass time would overwhelmingly be gaming, I'm always on the watch for what's new and exciting within this area and all tech for that matter really
