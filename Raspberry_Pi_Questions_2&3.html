<h3> What is the likely impact? </h3>

<p> I feel that the impact in relation to the development of Raspberry Pi’s is widely positive. This is due to the various benefits that Raspberry Pi’s have such as, they are very cost effective, they have a large processing power in a compact board and has a range of interfaces such as HDMI, multiple USB ports, Ethernet and much more. Due to the benefits and the accessibility of Raspberry Pi’s, the way in which many people, businesses, schools and even large companies will be affected in their approach when creating things such as complex programs or apps. As mentioned before this is mainly due to the affordability and the ease of use of the Raspberry Pi as it can be used to create many things that could help people and businesses in their daily lives, thus it would affect them heavily in a very beneficial way. Raspberry Pi’s are used all over the world to teach programming skills, build hardware, automate tasks throughout home and businesses and even for home or cyber security. The best thing about the Raspberry Pi is that it doesn’t take away the jobs of people, to which it does the complete opposite. Raspberry Pi’s heavily encourages people to create complex programs, systems and projects. In doing this, the Raspberry Pi helps people show big companies and businesses their skills and abilities which could lead to them gaining a job with a tech company or business. In some cases, many people have created complex programs and then sold it to companies to make a large profit. </p>



<h3> How will this affect you? </h3>

<p> With the constant developments made to and for the Raspberry Pi, we feel that the usage and functions of it will affect our group greatly. This is because it can help us learn new programming skills and improve on the skills that we may already have. Due to the rising cost of living and inflation of all things post pandemic, its cost effectiveness will greatly and positively affect us knowing that we have the peace of mind that we can turn our visions and ideas into a reality. We also feel that would have a benefit for us in our daily lives. This is because as mentioned above it could be used for home automation and security. So, it would do this such as at 7pm turn on porch lights or at 10pm turn on an alarm system. This will be different then making programs and application on standard pc as it shows how our programs would run on someone else's device. In doing that, shows if there would be any bugs and would show what operating systems could run the program. However, Raspberry Pi’s will affect our families and friends differently to us as they may not be looking to create any programs or systems. It will affect them as they may purchase or use a device that is powered by a Raspberry Pi for similar uses as mentioned above. The devices they may purchase include, a game emulator, a cheap laptop or even a Wi-Fi extender. In summary, for people like us who are interested in programing and IT, a raspberry Pi would be used and would affect the way and how we program. On the other hand, for our friends, family and people who aren’t interested in programming, a Raspberry Pi may be integrated into a purchased device. </p>
