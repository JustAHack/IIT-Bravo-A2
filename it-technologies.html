        <h3>Cloud Computing Services</h3>
        <span>Written by Jo Stammers and Thomas Kauran</span>
        <p>
          This section of the report will discuss Cloud, Servers and Services. It will discuss what cloud and servers are and the services that are provided. Following, will continue to explain the most remarkable aspects of cloud computing and a detailed explanation of what can be done using cloud computing now. Additionally, it will touch on what is upcoming for cloud computing along with what developments have an impact on the progress. Further, it will go on to explain the impact of cloud computing.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Cloud and what does it do?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud is simply a model of computing, it is “the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet” (Amazon AWS, no date). Resources include access to servers and networks, storage, development tools and applications (apps) that originally would need to be stored and accessed from privately owned and managed on hard drives and servers (Accenture, no date). Cloud Servers, known as Virtual Servers, are stable and fast and secure. They have all the software they require to run and can be accessed remotely via a cloud computing platform (Probrand, no date). There are two types of cloud computing, deployment models and service categories. Deployment models consist of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud. Service categories include, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (Accenture, no date).

        <h4>What are the most remarkable points of using cloud?</h4>
        <p>
          The ability to gain real-time access, on a global scale, to many services via use of the internet is cloud computing's greatest aspect. Deployment Models are a stand-out feature and the first selection to consider when choosing the services a business requires,

            Deploy Models
          </span>
        </div>
        <p>
          this is followed by choosing the Service Category (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) (Accenture, no date). 
        </p>

            Cloud Types
          </span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Cloud computing eliminates a large portion of the cost of purchasing hardware and software, the cost of running hardware and reduces number of IT staff required to manage infrastructure. The speed at which substantial amounts of resources can be accessed gives business flexibility and ease of capacity planning. Cloud services are accessed on a global scale allowing an elastic scaling, meaning more or less computing power, storage or bandwidth is delivered as required, furthering that power to save more on cost. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, a secure network of data centers are regularly upgraded to latest fast and efficient hardware, these data centers hosts the biggest of the cloud computing services eg. Azure, AWS, Google cloud. Another major benefit, also relieving costs and workload, is the productivity of using cloud computing; the need for hardware setup, software patching and many other time-consuming management responsibilities are irradicated. Further, the reliability of cloud computing makes business continuity, data backup and disaster recovery easier and less expensive and this is achievable by mirroring data on the provider's network (Azure, no date). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Cloud Computing Security has become its own discipline (BeyondTrust, no date). To help protect data, apps and infrastructure, providers usually offer a broad set of policies, include required technologies and controls to strengthen you overall security (Azure, no date).
        </p>

        <h4>What can be done now?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud services is powering customer innovation. Data Flair (no date) Identifies the 10 features of cloud computing, the following image displays these.
        </p>

            Cloud Features
          </span>
        </div>

        <p>
          Such features create benefits for both host and customers. The current possibilities using cloud computing are, creating cloud-native apps; test and build applications; store, back up and recover data; analyse data; deliver software on demand; communication; stream audio and video; embed intelligence (Azure, no date).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>"…it has become the ideal medium for testing and development, communication, storage and deployment of software." (DigitalCloud Training, no date) </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Microsoft (Azure), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alibaba (Alicloud) and Google (Google Cloud), known as MAAGs are the four main cloud service providers, these providers enable massive scaling and therefore named hyperscalers (Accenture, no date). Hyperscale cloud service providers (eg. Infosys, Atos, IBM, Oracle, etc.) are entities that use one or multiple of the hyperscalers to consult, design, develop, build and manage software, data and applications (Martin; Gabriel, 2021).
        </p>

        <h4>What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4>

        <p>
          Hyperscalers have been working on private cloud extensions. In the future it is likely that 'public cloud' and 'private cloud' will blend into a hybrid cloud umbrella, eventually phasing and instead being identified as 'dedicated' and 'shared' (Accenture, no date). Data Flare (no date) reported that researchers have proved that Cloud Computing will a leading technology in the future. Cloud computing requires modified software (Modular Sofware), this software will be more flexible and user-friendly and will provide much better facilities and security. Cloud computing is very cost-effective, powerful and expansive and will continue to grow and improve.
        </p>

        <h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>

        <p>
          Tech giants are looking to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process data and improve business functioning. With the use of AI, the efficiency of computing platforms is increasing. The future of cloud is heavily relying on ensuring users have a secure system to work with. DevSecOps is the process thinking of the infrastructure security from the start. DevSecOps will work on automating core security tasks and does this by embedding security controls into the workflow. Moreover, the service mesh is another critical component in cloud computing, the service mesh provides a safe communication environment by dedicating users a layer for service-to-service communication, which in turn creates a highly dynamic and secure platform. Additionally, Open-source cloud is providing a path of innovation and collaboration, it is a service built with software or technology that can be customized, allowing customers to customize infrastructure based on specific needs (Rapyder, 2021).
        </p>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>

        <p>
          The impact of cloud computing has had on the world of IT is tremendous. It has, in some way, impacted on almost every individual alive today. Education, social, health, navigation, shopping, or business are just a few examples. Cloud computing could be considered a revolutionary change to how data is stored, maintained, and made available across the world to any device with internet connection. From smart devices such as a fridge, watch, home entertainment system to a more powerful device such as a laptop or mobile phone, everything has access to the cloud with an internet connection. This has made a large impact on the lives of countless of the worlds' population (Willber, 2020). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Although it is difficult to predict the future of cloud computing, the work of the hyperscalers is likely to bring further ease of access, usage and maintenance to a varied but targeted range of users (Accenture, no date). Implementing the modular software will allow a greater plethora of functionality that will not only enrich business, but also the target audience of their products or services (DataFlare, no date). The impact of cloud computing is worldwide and is almost at a point it defines our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has impacted how businesses and organizations can manage their systems and data, but also how their customers access services (Willber, 2020). Cloud computing is what allows our homes and lives to be filled with the technologies available today. For businesses, the major beneficial effects are noticed are when comparing cloud computing to traditional computing, with the use of cloud services, businesses no longer need to develop or purchase software or purchase and maintain hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cloud service providers remotely provide management tasks, relieving the need for staffed or contracted technicians to fix technical problems (Watson, 2016). Additionally, individuals reap just as many benefits, cloud services have enabled the lives we live today. From entertainment, social/communication platforms, real-time access of cloud-based apps, navigation, online shopping, and personal storage are all services provided by cloud computing services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further, cloud computing has boosted the access and flexibility for the way education is delivered and the healthcare system has adopted cloud computing technology to manage, store and share patient information, allowing the individual and multiple health care professional to access information (Willber, 2020). Cloud services being adapted by a business or organization is described by Watson, 2016. as causing a shift in the structure of the organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The structure would create a significant workload shift leaving individuals with new responsibilities. Positions such as managers and customer relationship managers would be replaced by cloud services which ensure workers have access to all that is needed for their work criteria. It would also replace the jobs with responsibility of software and hardware within an organization (Watson, 2016).
        </p>

        <h4>How will Cloud Computing affect your daily lives?</h4>

        <p>
          Individually each team member may have varying response to how cloud affects them.
          One example is that one of us own a home security system that links several security cameras to a device that records and saves those recordings for several weeks. The device also allows the feed to be viewed from another device such as a computer or mobile phone. The affect the individual is that they can feel safe and secure knowing that when they come home, they can likely be certain no one is on their property and can have peace of mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          All before they step foot inside their home thanks to the live feed being available to them on their phone.
          Another example would be the project idea that our team has decided to move forward with. To create a mental health service available to male military veterans in Australia, and other emergency services. This service will be built on-top of cloud computing services to make the service available to anyone who needs it. With the use of technologies such as EC2 servers, S3 buckets and DynamoDB (All amazon cloud computing services) just to name a few.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, we can assume that as each team member continues their studies and eventually their careers in IT. each of us will continue to in turn work with cloud computing services in some form whether it is through building services on cloud computing infrastructure or using services that are built on top of cloud computing infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h4>What will be different for you?</h4>
        <p>
          The more each team member becomes familiar with cloud computing and the underlying technology, the more proficient we will become and more desirable our skillsets will be too. This will allow for each of us to use the technology in building portfolios to show potential employers, or clients and showcase our knowledge to obtain work, whether it be contracted work or full-time employment.

        </p>

        <p>
          Another impact may be that our lives become more invaded through concerns of privacy as more devices appear around us, and we have no knowledge of what these devices may do secretly, such as listening into conversation under the guise of “improving services”, recording the data we input to a device and companies using this information to “improve their services” as mentioned above.
        </p>

        <h4>
          How might this affect members of your family or friends?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Family and friends will likely already be impacted, and if not, are destined to be impacted in the future by the use of cloud services improving their lives. Whether it’s through online shopping, social and communication platforms or through entertainment such as streaming services and online radio etc., along with the advancing use within health and education systems allows for greater access an. 
          Cloud computing is everywhere in the lives of most people alive today.
