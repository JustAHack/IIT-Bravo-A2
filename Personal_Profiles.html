They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.<br>
                            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Adventurers are more sensitive to stress and can feel overwhelmed easier than Assertive (A) Adventurers. This characteristic can allow them to see little problems before they become big problems. Though Turbulent Adventurers are likely to feel more comfortable with themselves than the average Turbulent personality type, they are still less at ease in their own lives than Assertive Adventurers.”(Myers-Briggs, no date)

These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.<br>
                            Unexpected changes bother Logisticians more than any other personality type, and this is especially true for <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logisticians. However, in their ongoing need to improve and with their sense of uncertainty, they may actually be more willing to change, despite a certain amount of distress, than the more settled Assertive (A) Logisticians. Turbulent Logisticians are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to express and act on their emotions than Assertive personality types. The positive side of their more expressive emotions is that they can make them more accessible to others.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            Assertive (A) Logicians are likely to be more consistent than <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logicians due to confidence in the choices they make and being less influenced by others.
                            Turbulent Logicians change their goals more often than their Assertive cousins. This can make these personalities more flexible problem-solvers – though perhaps too flexible at times.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            Stress is less of an issue for Assertive (A) Entertainers. While difficult matters may hold the attention of <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Entertainers longer, it can also help them remain more aware, allowing them to perhaps alert or remind others of problems. Turbulent Entertainers tend to say they feel and express difficult emotions more than Assertive Entertainers. This tendency may create a conflict between their social natures and the need to express negative emotions – the two may not always be compatible.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Advocates are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. Both personality types are concerned with other people, but Assertive (A) Advocates are likely to be more hopeful, and Turbulent Advocates to focus on the difficult parts of a problem.  Because their regrets weigh on them more, Turbulent Advocates are more likely to learn from their mistakes than Assertive Advocates.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                        <h3>What these results mean for team Bravo…</h3>
                        <p>The Myers-Briggs test indeed shows the mixed profile of personalities within our team, while there is a few quite prominent differences, there are several similarities. Five members out of six classed as introverted and only one as an extravert. Half the team are classed as observant while the others intuitive. There are both thinkers and feelers among the group along with most being classed as prospecting with 2 members being the judging character. The varying approaches to things among the group is likely to allow some to work well while others are more reserved and less communicative. The Adventurers of the team have open minds and are present in the moment. Our team leader highlights a much different personality to most being rational, methodical, and unexpected changes are a hassle to this Logistician. The flexible thinking and creativity of our Logician member brings in a different style to the group. The ‘Entertainer’ of our group, the individual extravert, likes to engage vibrantly and enjoys discovering the unknown. And having an Advocate in the group brings a member who has deep thoughtfulness and imagination, is quiet but uses these traits to provide successful outcomes (Myers-Briggs, no date). All members are of the Turbulent trait which, although means something different to each personality type, allows Bravo, as a team to combine their abilities to overcome small issues before they become big. An ongoing need for improvement adds to the drive of the group, especially in a team leader. Further, flexibility in problem solving is important in any group and with an ability to hold attention on difficult matters the team extrovert may just come in needed. Finally having the traits of a worry-led Advocate could push the final outcome of the team assessment due to the need to focus on difficult parts of a problem (Myers-Briggs, no date). Overall, the combined traits amongst the members of team Bravo, although quite varied, blend reasonably. The team had built its hierarchy before understanding this combined information, yet the positions held would match the traits explained in the results of the personality test.</p>

With the team leader standing out with Kinaesthetic learning, other members seem to be a mix of auditory and visual learners. Having a mixture of learning styles within a group is certainly beneficial to a team as all members bring a mix of abilities and ideas. The team appears to communicate well and each member is comfortable with their positions in the team. Work seems to come together well and the combination of learning style, skill and differing knowledge just seems to mould the groups work efforts with ease.</p>
