                            “An <strong>Adventurer (ISFP)</strong> is a person with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Feeling (F), and Prospecting (P) personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.<br>
                            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Adventurers are more sensitive to stress and can feel overwhelmed easier than Assertive (A) Adventurers. This characteristic can allow them to see little problems before they become big problems. Though Turbulent Adventurers are likely to feel more comfortable with themselves than the average Turbulent personality type, they are still less at ease in their own lives than Assertive Adventurers.”(Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            “A <strong>Logistician (ISTJ)</strong>Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted (I), Observant (S), Thinking (T), and Judging (J) personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.<br>
                            Unexpected changes bother Logisticians more than any other personality type, and this is especially true for <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logisticians. However, in their ongoing need to improve and with their sense of uncertainty, they may actually be more willing to change, despite a certain amount of distress, than the more settled Assertive (A) Logisticians. Turbulent Logisticians are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to express and act on their emotions than Assertive personality types. The positive side of their more expressive emotions is that they can make them more accessible to others.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            “A <strong>Logician (INTP)</strong> is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.<br>
                            Assertive (A) Logicians are likely to be more consistent than <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Logicians due to confidence in the choices they make and being less influenced by others.
                            Turbulent Logicians change their goals more often than their Assertive cousins. This can make these personalities more flexible problem-solvers – though perhaps too flexible at times.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                        <td>
                            “An <strong>Entertainer (ESFP)</strong> is a person with the Extraverted (E), Observant (S), Feeling (F), and Prospecting (P) personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities".<br>
                            Stress is less of an issue for Assertive (A) Entertainers. While difficult matters may hold the attention of <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Entertainers longer, it can also help them remain more aware, allowing them to perhaps alert or remind others of problems. Turbulent Entertainers tend to say they feel and express difficult emotions more than Assertive Entertainers. This tendency may create a conflict between their social natures and the need to express negative emotions – the two may not always be compatible.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)

                            “An <strong>Advocate (INFJ)</strong> is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.<br>
                            <em>Turbulent</em> <strong>(T)</strong> Advocates are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. Both personality types are concerned with other people, but Assertive (A) Advocates are likely to be more hopeful, and Turbulent Advocates to focus on the difficult parts of a problem.  Because their regrets weigh on them more, Turbulent Advocates are more likely to learn from their mistakes than Assertive Advocates.” (Myers-Briggs, no date)
